# Diversity Equity and Inclusion in Engineering - ENGR2301
 > Citizenship in Engineering Contexts

## What is this course for?

- We will be learning about and exploring key concepts related to engineering and citizenship for a just and diverse world.
- Pursuing an individual line of inquiry into a problem/need/opportunity in a local community through meaningful research and evidence-based reasoning.

`RFP` - A request for proposal.  
This is what we will be dealing with in the class. It is when a funding organization asks for submissions of proposals on what to do with their money, so that they can choose who to give it to.

## Course Structure

`Phase 1` - Individual research and problem explorations (Weeks 1-7)  
`Phase 2` - Forming project groups, defining the problem, and developing a proposed solution (Weeks 8-12)  
`Phase 3` - Communicating the proposal to multiple audiences (Week 13-finals)
