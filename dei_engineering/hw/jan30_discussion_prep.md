## Engineers Engaging Community: Water and Energy
 - Increasingly engineers are taking responsibility for the broader effects of their designs
 - Argues for a different definition of `Economic Health`
    - Focus on improving individual lives rather than market expansion
    - This will "enable sustainable economic growth"
    - Don't use the flawed measure of GDP, or at least supplement it

A new economic map composed of six sectors:
 - Household economy
 - Market economy
 - Unpaid community economy
 - Illegal economy
 - Government economy
 - Natural economy

Anothe framing has fourteen indicators of the "State of Society" incorporating both economic health and human well-being:
 - Poverty
 - Health
 - Education
 - Employment
 - Income and Wealth
 - Shelter
 - Natural Environment
 - Political Participation
 - Civil Society
 - Economic Participation
 - Human Rights
 - National Stability and Sustainability
 - Family and Household Well-being
 - Personal Well-being

A shift is described within water, sanitation, and energy managment from a "supply led approach" to a "demand responsive approach," which comes with a share of challenges.

## When We Almost Stopped Climate Change
 - By the 1950s scientists knew about the effects of fossil fuels on the environment.
 - In 1979 a political lobbyist finds out about this information
 - He decided to set up meetings with scientists and the government, expecting those in power to do the responsible thing
 - Reagan won the election and appointed officials uninterested in the issue
 - In 1985 there is a discovery about the o-zone diminishing
 - By 1987 the `Montreal Protocol` is the first global atmospheric environmental treaty
    - Exists as a template for a global warming solution
 - There's set to be a hearing in front of the senate about global warming
 - Scientists say the increased temperature of recent years is due to the `Greenhouse Effect`
 - By 1988 there were 32 environmental bills
 - George Bush campaigns on it
 - After he takes office, there arise divisions
 - A scientist's testimony for a hearing about the issue is heavily censored, to make his conclusions seem less certain
 - At an internation meeting to discuss proposals for solving climate change, the US delegation refuses to support any proposals with hard targets or specific emmissions reductions in mind
 - After this fails, the oil and gas industry mobilizes to spread misinformation about the issue


## Major US science group lays out a path to smooth the energy transition
 - Major climate-focused laws have been passed in 2021 and 2022 including the `Inflation Reduction Act`
 - Policies in this agenda must also deal with historical harms, such as redlining
 - Recent climate policy efforts put together could reduce America's emissions by as much as 80% by 2030
 - The transition is "not only technical but social, and political, and institutional"
 - There is more that can be done
 - Justice40 executive order promises 40% of all climate spending to go to historically disadvantaged communities
 - Equity and buy-in are the most important aspects


## Montana youth climate ruling could set precedent for future climate litigation
 - 16 young plaintiffs have brought a suit about the state promoting harmful fossil fuel energy policies
 - First time a US court ruled that "young peoplpe have a fundamental right to a climate system that is safe and stable for their lives"
 - State Laws passed in 2011 prevented Montana agencies from considering climate impacts when permitting energy projects (such as coal and gas)
 - The field of climate-related law is growing rapidly
 - Montana's constitution is unique, which might prevent the ruling from being helpful precedent in other states
 

## How Green Space Fosters Safe Communities
 - Green spaces can actually reduce violence
 - Creates a place designated for peole to interact and feel like a community with a sense of security
 - Helps to reduce the heat island effect of asphalt
 - Grass and trees were shown in a number of studies to reduce gun violence
 - Community engagement is key

## Prep Questions
 > Oldham et al. (2013) cited Leon and Boris' (2010) fourteen indicators of "economic health and human well-being." Which of the indicators on the list have you previously considered in relation to your field (your intended professional track)? How so? Is there one you hadn't explicitly connected to your professional/academic work yet but can now see a potential connection?

I've considered many of them in relation to my intended field (CSE), including education, employment, political and economic participation, civil society, human rights, national stability and sustainability, and personal well-being. I think one of these indicatiors I haven't explicitly connected with before but I see now is with poverty, and using technology as a means to help those who are disadvantaged. We've talked about this a good amount with adopting technology and disadvantaged communities needing additional help when it comes to citizenship, and I think this is something that coule be applied in my career.
 > What observations can you make about the ways scientific findings affect public policy decisions based on these readings (and podcast)?

Unfortunately what I have to observe is that they can inform policy, but ultimately won't determine it, even when the evidence is overwhelming. I think the podcast about climate was particularly dissappointing as such an important thing was kicked down the road, ultimately just because of petty politics and without regard for the well-being of the citizens of the United States (and the rest of the world), and the degree of apathy towards their roles held by the highest government officials in carrying out their duties to help people.
 > What connections can you make between the rights and responsibilities of citizenship and these wide-ranging environmental issues?

I think the biggest connection I can make is that of participation. It is emphasized as a part of `engaged citizenship,` and ultimately participation is what determines what climate policies work, and which ones don't. Every paper and article has reinforced this point, and it just makes sense. Even when those in power go against what is in everyone's best interest, as in the example of climate change shown in the podcast, if citizens are engaged enough in participating in efforts to make politicians deal with the problem, that is when things will get solved.
