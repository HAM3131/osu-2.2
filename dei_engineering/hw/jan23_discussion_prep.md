## Digital Citizenship: The Internet, Society, and Participation
Three aspects of participation in society online:
 - inclusion in communication through regular and effective use
 - impact of the Internet on the ability to participate as democratic citizens
 - effects of internet on equality of opportunity in the marketplace

This book views digital citizenship as "representing capacity, belonging, and the potential for political and economic engagement in society in the information age."

`Spillover benefits` - whenever the internet helps individuals to be more educated or likely to take part in the political process, not only does that individual benefit, but so does the society as a whole.

We will "examine whether and how the Internet is integral for economic opportunity and political participation" and determine from that whether everyone should have the right to use it if they choose.  

The paper poses three competing US traditions regarding citizenship:
 - `liberalism` - focused on economic opportunity
    - believe that all Americans are born equal
    - emphasizes the equality of opportunity more than equality of outcome
    - "Government support for education stands in stark contrast to other social policy in the United States, in part because of the belief that education can provide a level playing field—the equality of opportunity, if not the equality of result. For this reason, Jennifer Hochschild and Nathan Scovronick (2000, 209) have perceptively called public education the U.S. version of the 'welfare state.’"
    - paper poses that "digital citizenship may rival formal education in its importance for economic opportunity"
    - for this reason, on the basis of economic opportunity public policy to expand access to technology may be justified
 - `republicanism` - focused on political participation
    - percieves participation as a duty toward the community rather than the individual rights of liberalism
    - takes the perspective that public education improves the societal outcome of participation
    - the Internet is also a tool in educating "virtuous citizens"
    - "Previous research has found that online news may have a mobilizing potential, increasing political participation"
    - for these reasons, expanded technology access could be justified for the advancement of civic republicanism
 - `ascriptive hierarchy` - explains persistence of inequality based on race and ethnicity
    - this tradition is the one which has excluded the population from citizenship based on `ascriptive characteristics` such as race, gender, or ethnicity.
    - "Rodney Hero (1992, 189) has called this ‘two-tiered pluralism,’ in which some citizens enjoy formal legal equality, but in practice suffer discrimination and diminished opportunities."
    - `digital divide` - a term discribing the disparity in access to technology for those who are disadvantaged
    - expansion of access may be justified through this framework as well, to remove barriers to participate online for racial and ethnic minorities

Paper posits that frequency of use serves as as more accurate measure for digital citizenship than means of access through the home, or simply having used it rarely in the past.  
In addition to, and intertwined with, frequency of use is information literacy and technical skills. In order for access to the internet to be valuable and adoptable, those who are not already online must already have or be able to learn these skills.

## Youth and Digital Citizenship
One interesting thing differentiating digital citizenship from what we read before about citizenship is that it includes the youth. Children under 18 can't exercise political rights as citizens, and in many other ways are not granted the same freedoms as adults. In the digital sphere though, the conversation is extended to them.

`Digital Citizenship` was first put forth in 2004 by Mike Ribble as "the norms of behavior with regard to technology use."  
Another way to look at is how "young people today are engaging with civics and politics in ways different from teh notion of citizenship characteristic of previous generations." This perspective more or less describes a shift we saw in our previous reading away from `citizen duty` and towards `engaged citizenship.`  
For example, "many youth today are expressing their voice around civic issues by creating and circulating media such as memes, blogs, or videos."

The Council of Europe defines digital citizenship as "the capacity to participate actively, continuously and responsibly in communities (local, national, global, online and offline) at all levels (political, economic, social, cultural and intercultural)."

The paper notes that with increased connection to the digital world, both the real and digital world are becoming increasingly blended for young people--so why not just use the term "citizenship?" Does focusing on digital citizenship take away from the reality that the most important forms of participation are the online activities that lead to offline engagement?  
Similarly, the idea of "citizenship" may not be a thing youth can relate to, especially when the conversation about it is dominated by adults who have not consulted with the youth their policies are affecting. 

 > "One, by adding “digital,” we believe the concept more strongly showcases the role and agency youth have in fostering their empowerment and visibility. Two, “digital” in combination with “citizenship” makes it more plausible that youth will engage with this concept, even if they are not of the legal voting age, as it appears to be a more flexible and open notion than other forms of citizenship. Three, compared to other concepts, such as digital literacy and new media literacies, digital citizenship generally appears to be more holistic, and thus, in our opinion, a more helpful notion to refer to when debating important areas of life related to the digital landscape, as well as the corresponding skills needed to be successful within those areas."

Whether the term of "digital citizenship" is helpful on it's own or not, it is useful when discussing policy as many governments have chosen to use this term.

`Digital Citizenship+ (plus)` - Broadens the conversation and questions the scope of the term
 - Keeps the term universal but flexible
 - More encompassing of different social, cultural, and regional contexts.
 - defined as "the skills needed for youth to fully participate academically, socially, ethically, politically, and economically in our rapidly evolving digital world.

`Digital Literacy` - "an individual's ability to use information and communication technologies to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information using both cognitive and technical skills"
 - early conceptualizations focused on technical skills
 - "mastering ideas, not keystrokes"
 - another conceptualization defines it as "the convergence of multiple literacies, including aspects of media literacy, visual literacy, information literacy, and ITC literacy."

`Digital Competence` - "the confident and critical use of Information Society Technology (IST) for work, leisure and communication."

## How to Put Out Democracy's Dumpster Fire
 > "The civic habits necessary for a functioning republic have been killed off by an internet kleptocracy that profits from disinformation, polarization, and rage. Here’s how to fix that."

- The Internet has taken away from participation in civic organizations which give a sense of community
   - replaced by Internet mobs
 - "Even as our polity deteriorates, an internet that promotes demo- cratic values instead of destroying them—that makes conversation better instead of worse— lies within our grasp"
 - The unregulated internet has amplified misinformation and conspiracy theories, to the detriment of society
 - After 2020 Election Facebook implemented policies to make its site nicer, but later reversed them
   - means Facebook always CAN make their site better for civil conversation and discourage disinformation
   - but Facebook's interests aren't necessarily aligned with the public's
 - "he current design of the internet makes it easier than ever to target vulnerable audiences with pro- paganda, and gives conspiracy thinking more prominence"
 - "Wikipedia is a glimpse of the internet that might have been: a not-for-profit, collaborative space where disparate people follow a common set of norms as to what constitutes evidence and truth, helped along by public-spirited moderators. "
 - "Focusing on regulating algorithms, by contrast, would mean that companies wouldn’t be liable for each tiny piece of content, but would have legal responsibility for how their products distribute and amplify material. This is, after all, what these companies actually do: organize, target, and magnify other people’s content and data. Shouldn’t they take responsibility for that?"
 - "Maybe it’s time to let independent researchers test the impact of algorithms, share the results, and—with the public’s participation—decide which ones are most useful."
   - "we have to not just take control of our own data, but also help oversee the design of algorithmic experiments, with 'individual participation and consent at all decision levels possible.'"
 - Radio was welcomed like the internet, then immediately warped by authoritarians
 - "And part of what we should be building are networks that have explicit social promise."
 - We should make at least part of the internet into a place where partisan groups argue about specific problems
 - perhaps moderated public service social media
   - Polis is a cool example of this, with voting instead of replies. The algorithm focuses on those who generate agreement



## Discussion Questions
 - Do you think what it means to be a digital citizen has changed since Mossberger et al.’s publication in 2008? How so?

I think the definition has remained the same for the most part, though some aspects of it, namely digital literacy and technical skills are more important. Especially with growing amounts of misinformation on the internet, I think that the ability to discern a source's trustworthiness is essential in being a digital citizen. Not only is it essential for the positive side of the Internet, having access to the Internet without the ability to tell when something is misinformation can be actively harmful rather than helpful.

 - What connections do you observe between the definitions of “digital citizenship” in Cortesi et al. (2020) and the other readings and frameworks related to citizenship we have discussed thus far (e.g., Marshall, Dalton)?

 Both Marshall’s classical definition of citizenship and Cortesi et al.'s concept of digital citizenship emphasize the importance of rights and responsibilities. Marshall focuses on civil, political, and social rights, while Cortesi et al. extend this to digital rights, such as privacy, freedom of expression online, and access to digital resources. Dalton's work on citizenship highlights the role of citizen engagement and participation in a democratic society. Similarly, digital citizenship as defined by Cortesi et al. encompasses active participation in online communities and digital platforms, fostering a sense of belonging and engagement in the digital realm. Both traditional and digital citizenship underscore the importance of education. Marshall views education as a key social right, necessary for informed participation in society. Cortesi et al. extend this to include digital literacy, emphasizing the need for skills to navigate, understand, and contribute to the digital world effectively.

 - Applebaum and Pomerantsev (2021) describe a shift from "active to passive” internet experiences—what do they say caused this? What are the implications of this shift on the individual and society? 

They say this was caused by a few individual corporations taking control of the Internet and implementing systems which help only themselves. This switch makes individuals less powerful and free.

 - In discussing specific ways to “make the internet less awful,” Applebaum and Pomerantsev provide a number of specific examples of principles or mechanisms that could change online interactions. Which most stand out to you and why?

In the discussion on how to "make the internet less awful," two standout ideas presented by Applebaum and Pomerantsev are the regulation of algorithms and the concept of public service social media. This idea is particularly striking because of the immense impact algorithms have on shaping online experiences. Algorithms dictate what content we see, influencing our perceptions, opinions, and even emotions. By regulating algorithms, there's potential to create a more balanced and less polarized online environment. This regulation could involve transparency in how algorithms function, ensuring they promote diverse viewpoints rather than just reinforcing existing biases or feeding echo chambers. The importance of this approach lies in its direct influence on the quality of information and discourse that users encounter daily on the internet. The notion of public service social media is another compelling concept. It suggests the creation of digital platforms that operate on principles similar to public broadcasting services, prioritizing the public good over profit. The way Polis, a specific example of this kind of platform, is designed is particularly fascinating. Polis helps to facilitate more constructive and less divisive discourse by allowing for a more nuanced understanding of public opinion. It visualizes consensus and divides in opinions, encouraging users to engage in more thoughtful and less confrontational discussions. This approach stands out because it addresses the root cause of much online hostility and miscommunication, offering a platform designed to foster healthier, more productive conversations.

 - How do your ideas about what it means to be a citizen with the rights and responsibilities we’ve been discussing translate into digital or online spaces? What does it mean to you to be a “good citizen” on the internet? Cortesi et al. (2020) outline "six digital competencies" that are taught in (some) US schools (p. 14). Were you taught any of these competencies, explicitly, in school? If so, how did they shape your conception of "digital citizenship"?

The core idea of participation plays out, and it was interesting how the readings noted that in some ways, digital citizenship transforms the way that people participate from the idea of `citizen duty` to `engaged citizenship,` but still the most important activities online are those that translate to offline. Competencies I was taught in mostly related to safety as they described older teaching being taught around--safety from cyber bullying and also evaluation of a source's reliability. I think this especially made me conscious of misinformation, and especially given current events that has only strengthened. I think the key to digital citizenship, more than anything else, is the ability to distinguish between real information and propaganda.
