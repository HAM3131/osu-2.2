# Discussion Prep - Jan 18

## Citizenship and Social Class

 - Marshal was an economist and idealist, who wanted to put economics at the service of public policy
 - In his works, there were things [social force] which could not be explained by economics
 - In one work, Marshal started venturing into the field of sociology which can explain these social forces
    - With regards to social equity
 - He believed that eventually the working class would become "gentlemanly"
    - This meaning not equal, but that their work would be reduced and made better
 - Marshal was opposed to socialism but had his own system
    - Wanted to maintain the "free market"
    - But the government must compel some things (ie, education of children)
 - One way Marshal began to diverge from economics was in his description of the working class
    - When we say a man belong to the working classes, 'we are thinking of the effect that his work produces on him rather than the effect that he produces on his work'
    - Movement away from a quantitative analysis of standards of living towards qualitative
 - Marshal's hyphothesis includes the idea that citizenship has an association with basic human equality
    - Because of his distaste for the state, he did not propose this in the form of right
    - He described it only in terms of duties, and not rights

(Everything I took notes on up to this point I did not need to read lol)

The reading will divide citizenship into the three parts of `civil,` `political,` and `social.`  
 - `Civil Element` - the rights necessary for individual freedom
 - `Political Element` - the right to participate in the exercise of political power
 - `Social Element` - the right to some amount of economic welfare and to share in the social heritage of the society
The further you look back, the more intertwined these three ideas are, but over time they are further separated.  
In feudal times, there was no unified idea of the rights and equality of a citizen which could stand against the inequality of class.  
Over time the institutions for administering each of these parts of citizenship developed and separated. This allowed each aspect of citizen's equality to develop at it's own pace.  

The right to education is a significant part of the social element to citizenship because it "aims to shape the future adult".  
 - A point is also made here that educating oneself is not only a personal duty, but a social duty
 - This is because society needs its citizens to be educated for a variety of reason (voting, technical work, research, etc.)

Two opposing principles:
 - Citizenship stands as a force for equality while social class is inherently representative of inequality
 - How then did these two things, citizenship and (capitalist) social class, develop together?

## Chapter 2: The Meaning and Measurement of Citizenship
Opens with a quote from George W. Bush encouraging citizenship vaguely - citizenship is not always agreed upon, but is generally agreed to be good. So more must be better.  

### Citizenship in Theory
 > What makes a good citizen?  
 - Citizenship can be traced back to debates between Aristotle and Plato about how a good citizen of Athens should act
This book defines citizenship as "a shared set of expectations about the citizen's role in politics."  

 - Political participation is a fundamental part of citizenship in democratic societies
 - Another feature of citizenship is accepting the authority of the state
 - Additionally there is the social aspect, where none of the other features are consequential unless certain basic needs are met

### What is a "good" citizen?
American's were surveyed on how they figured each of the following categories is to being a "good" citizen. Not based on their own behaviors, but on perceived norms:
 - `Participation`
 - `Autonomy`
 - `Social order`
 - `Solidarity`

The study showed that Americans strongly link `participation` with `social order` to make a super-category of something like `citizen duty`.  
Additionally, they group `autonomy` and `solidarity` into the super-category of `engaged citizenship`.  

### The Distribution of Citizenship Norms
The data shows that Americans hold both `citizen duty` and `engaged citizenship` to be highly important, though the activities like "following the law," "paying taxes," and "voting" which are associated with `citizen duty` recieve greater emphasis.  
Another key takeaway is that the two surveys from 2004 and 2014 bear little substantive difference in polling results, despite significant political and social upheaval in the period between. 

## Chapter 3: The Good Citizen
The norms associated with citizenship are not randomly distributed through the population, they are inluenced by political forces, generation, social status, race, partisanship, and more.  

### A Generational Gap?
There is a difference in the norms enforced by generation
 - Older generations tend to focus on `citizen duty`
 - Younger generations are often disparaged because they are seen as caring less for these norms
`Ronald Inglehart`'s research argues that younger generations are as engaged, but in other ways
 - namely, `engaged citizenship`

There is data to support this from the surveys in the previous chapter (2004 and 2014), but these surveys measure the effect of age more so than generation, as it is generally understood that as groups age they place greater focus on duty. Looking closely at the data, this can account for some of the difference, but not the full generational gap.

### The Rising Tide of Social Status
Education is correllated with (very marginally) lower emphasis on `citizen duty` and an increase in `engaged citizenship`. Income and wealth can also have an effect on this.  
The study takes from this that social modernization has led to a shift in citizenship norms.

### Gender and Ethnicity Patterns
Women place more emphasis on several aspects of `citizen duty`.  
Differences in `engaged citizenship` are minor.  
Minorities scored higher in the survey in terms of emphasis on `engaged citizenship` norms and lower on `citizen duty`.

### Citizenship and Religion
Protestants and catholics score above average on the survey for `citizen duty`, while no religion scores substantially below average.
There is a clear link between religion and affects on, mostly duty-based, citizenship.

### Partisan Differences in Citizenship
Republican's score above average on `citizen duty` and at the average on `engaged citizenship`. The opposite is true of Democrats. Independents are below average in both.

To conclude on this, it makes sense that different generation and groups can't agree on citizenship, because they conceive of different kinds of "good" citizens.

## Discussion Prep Questions

 - How do you understand the different "parts" of citizenship outlined by Marshall?  

I feel like I understand them reasonably well, though I feel as though the 'civil' and 'political' aspects are so heavily intertwined I don't know how you can really have one without the other. Without the 'political' dimension of citizenship, an individual could not protect their 'civil' rights, and in the same way, without personal freedoms afforded by 'civil' liberty it seems near impossible to participate politically.

 - In a discussion of the relationship between state-mandated education (see pp. 25-7), Marshall states that “the education of children has a direct bearing on citizenship” (p. 26) and he includes education in the “social element” of citizenship. Examine this part of the reading related to education and consider the arguments made—what stands out to you? Have you thought about compulsory education and public education in these terms? What does it make you think about you in your own experiences?   

I found this very interesting, and it is a unique way of reframing the idea of education. I agree that the social benefits of having educated citizens are great, and there is reason to compel education for that cause, so it is another way to look at the motivation behind it. I think both the social and personal benefits of education are sufficient for it to be worthwhile for the state to enforce it. I also find it funny the way that Marshall tries to restrain himself from supporting government interference in other areas for social good when he clearly sees the value of it here. I feel there are numerous other places a similar compulsion could be put into practice (enforcing sustainability requirements for businesses for example) which I imagine he would not support if he were alive today simply because he didn't want to be 'like the socialists'.  

 - Dalton talks about shifting perceptions of citizenship and democratic participation, mostly focusing on the time period from “The Greatest Generation” to “Millennials.” What is your sense of what the next generation(s) might feel about citizenship, democratic participation, and/or social engagement? What changes to the U.S. and global political and social context are not accounted for in Dalton’s overview because of when it was written? 

That's a really good question and I don't know if I have a very good perspective on the whole of my generation, but at least from my perspective and that of my friends I can see a definite continuation of the trend towards `engaged citizenship`. Its hard as a young person to compare what I feel like is new to my generation because I wasn't there for the Millenials or Gen X, etc, but I feel like the duty to vote has been pretty strongly emphasized for me and people I know, and would also be placed highly, though the other aspects of `citizen duty` might still be lower.

 - Dalton’s Chapter 3 explores how norms of citizenship are formed and factors that may influence how one understands citizenship norms. Can you think of other factors that may influence one’s conception of citizenship norms?  

A few I can think of off the top of my head are social class, immigrant status (in addition to ethnicity), global experience (like visiting other countries), social media usage/platform choice, etc.
