## Citizenship and Social Class

 - Marshal was an economist and idealist, who wanted to put economics at the service of public policy
 - In his works, there were things [social force] which could not be explained by economics
 - In one work, Marshal started venturing into the field of sociology which can explain these social forces
    - With regards to social equity
 - He believed that eventually the working class would become "gentlemanly"
    - This meaning not equal, but that their work would be reduced and made better
 - Marshal was opposed to socialism but had his own system
    - Wanted to maintain the "free market"
    - But the government must compel some things (ie, education of children)
 - One way Marshal began to diverge from economics was in his description of the working class
    - When we say a man belong to the working classes, 'we are thinking of the effect that his work produces on him rather than the effect that he produces on his work'
    - Movement away from a quantitative analysis of standards of living towards qualitative
