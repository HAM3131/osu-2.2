# First Week Intro Note

## Me
My name is Henry Alexander Manning, I go by Henry, and I've gone by HAM before because my initials spell it out, or my Latin name was Romulus for five years from 8-12th grade. I use Romulus as my account name for a lot of things online because I think it sounds cool, even though it isn't really. I go by he/him pronouns just like my two brothers, but unlike my transfemme sister.

I am studying CSE (Computer Science and Engineering) because I have always loved computers, and I have always loved creating things. And creating is a lot of what Engineering is to me. I've always been fascinated by how things worked, and what I most want to do is create things which will help or improve the lives of as many pepole as possible. I'm from Madeira, which is a smallish town near Cincinnati, Ohio, where I was always a top student and played three sports--football, basketball, and baseball.

I'm interested in lots of technology. Especially computers. AI and Cybersecurity are my greatest interests in computing, and I've worked a bit in each of them. This past summer I had the opportunity to help implementing AI tools at the Cincinnati Insurance Company, and next summer I will be working at Northrop Grumman on cybersecurity applications. I spend a lot of my weekends at school on CTFs (Capture The Flags) which are cybersecurity competition where you try to exploit vulnerable systems to find the 'flags' for points. While I'm not at school, I have a group of friends at home who I love playing all kinds of different board games with. My favorites are Dune, Sidereal Confluence, Root, Cosmic Encounters, and many others. I also like to play lots of Video Games, as well as loving a wide variety of TV and movies.

I got here by being extremely good at high school and test taking. I got so lucky with my home environment and the peers I met in school that it was never difficult for me, and I got a 36 on my ACT without studying. Now I need to study, and that's one of the skills I most need to improve on.

## Class Goals
 - What do you hope to learn? -> I want to learn about the kinds of rhetoric which are useful for getting a grant. It sounds like a very useful skill and could apply to me at some point.
 - What do you want to bring to the class? -> I want to bring an open mind an hopefully contribute a good amount to group discussions. In high school english classes were never my favorites but I think I want to approach it with a different attitude this semester and have a good time.
 - What skills do you want to work on? -> I want to work on my writing skills (obviously). Specifically, I think my fundamental writing is very strong. I am very competent when it comes to grammar and spelling, but I want to improve the way I structure my writing to be more engaging and 'powerful'.

## Course Themes Intitial Reaction
The course driving question are all interesting to me, but ones which resonate the most are about how identifying accurate, credible information online allows us to function better as citizens, and what engineering problems or products affect society. I think these hold personal interest for me because they are applicable to me, and reflect what I have seen in the world. When I hear 'citizenship,' 'diversity,' 'equity,' 'inclusion,' and 'justice' I think of powerful ideals that are great in concept, but elusive in the world. And I hope that one of the things this class can do is make it easier for me to implement these ideals in my life.

## Optional content
I got a new puppy last semester!! It's really exciting and he is already getting much bigger. He's the same breed as my previous dog, who just passed last year, so he will probably end up the same size at around 100lbs.
