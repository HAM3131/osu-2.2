## History of the Engineering Design Process in Education

The engineering design process is defined by Agogino et al. (2005) as "a systematic, intelligent process in which designers generate, evaluate, and specify concepts for devices, systems, or processes whose form and function achieve clients’ objectives or users’ needs while satisfying a specified set of constraints," and as such it is a crucial part of the education of all prospective engineers: "The engineering design process has become an intricate part of both the engineering profession and engineering curriculum" (Milcarek et al., 2016). The idea is not static though, as changes to the needs and requirements of those clients and users have shifted, so have the methods of engineers.  
An example of this is found in how Schnackel Engineers (2023) describe "MEP engineering design gained prominence." As industry changed and consolidated, "more complex buildings and factories required more efficient heating, ventilation, and cooling systems as well as reliable electrical and plumbing infrastructure." This led to an evolution of design specifically targetting these affected areas. "The growing global concern for natural resources and sustainability" has been another driving force in the growth of engineering design, and it "has led to the successful introduction of sustainability engineering courses in undergraduate and graduate engineering curricula" (Milcarek et al.). The concept of engineering design is broad, but specializations also develop in constant response to the world.
