> How is a wikipedia structured?

A wikipedia has a couple of structural elements. History comes first. This is because we are story telling creatures and we understand the structure of 
 - Where has it been?
 - Where is it now?
 - Where is it going?
It makes sense to approach something from this perspective. It is also interesting to note that at the top of the Wikipedia page the information is more broad and all-encompassing, and as you get further into the article the roots deepen and spread out into more specific topics.
