# Lecture 3

 - A = B union C
    - A = (B' inter C')'
    - P(A) = P(B) + P(C) - P(B inter C)
 - A = B inter C
    - A = (B' union C')'
    - P(A) = P(B) + P(C) - P(B union C)

P(A inter B') = P(A) - P(A inter B)

 > Basically today is a bunch of examples, and I am working on HW 1 while she does these. Above are the useful rules she discussed.

## Binary Outcomes

Consider an event S = "success".  
Then it's complement S' = F = "failure".  
Are S and F disjoint? Yes.

## Permutations / Combinations

 - `nPr` - the number of permutations of `r` individuals from a sample of `n`
    - Calculated by n!/(n-r)!
 - `nCr` - the number of combinations of `r` individuals from a sample of `n`
    - Calculated by n!/[r!(n-r)!]
