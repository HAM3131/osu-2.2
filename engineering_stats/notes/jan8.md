### What is statistics?
```
Statistics is the art and science of collecting, analyzing, and using data effectively to achieve a desired/necessary outcome.

### Terminology

 - `Population`: A population is the entire collection of individials or objects to be studied.
 - `Sample`: A sample is a subset of the entire population, a small selsction of indivifuals or objects taken from the entire collection.
 - `Variable`: A variable is a characteristic of an individual or object in a population of interest.

Notably, there are usually too many individuals in a population to observe them all. Thus, a sample is used to estimate. We use the sample to learn about the population.

 - `Descriptive Statistics`: Data is summarized and presented ina form that is easy for a reader to understand. Often using graphics.
 - `Inferential Statistics`: The process of using data collected on a sample to draw a conclusion about the population.
 - `Statistical Inference`: The conclusion drawn in inferential statistics.

```
Example: A random sample of 22 women was obtained, and each was asked what "non-physical" feature they find most appealing in men.

What is the population, sample, and variable in this situation? 
    population = all women  
    sample = 22 women  
    variable = "non-physical" feature  
```

### Data Generation

  - `Existing Sources`: Company databases, the internet, government agencies, etc.
  - `Statistical Studies`: There are `Experimental Studies` and `Observational Studies`. These are processes which generate well-defined outcomes. Only one of the possible outcomes occurs on a single repetition of the experiment.

### Population Parameters and Sample Statistics
We use a `sample statistic` to estimate a `population parameter`.
 - `Sample Statistic`: Numbers that describe a sample.
 - `Population Parameter`: Numbers that describe a population.
 
Population Parameters | Sample Statistics
--- | ---
Population mean = mu | Sample mean = x-bar
Population standard deviation = sigma | Sample standard deviation = s
Population proportion = P | Sample proportion = p-hat
Correlation coefficient = rho_xy | Sample correlation coefficien = r_xy
