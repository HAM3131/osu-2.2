# Engineering Stats - STAT3470.01

The course has it's homework and textbook through carmenbooks. There is a Cengage account involved. I created a new account with email `manning.545@osu.edu` and password `Wdtpntbsl?3131C`.

The professor says the class will be very fast (we'll see!). There are four things which count for a grade. These are the "Achieve" Quizzes, "Achieve" Homework, Recitation Assignments, and Exams. The "Achieve" assignments are the ones given through Cengage. There are NO DROPPED HOMEWORKS. There are FOUR dropped quizzes. In total there will be 12 quizzes.

There is other information in the syllabus, but it's not extraordinarily useful. The lectures are recorded.
