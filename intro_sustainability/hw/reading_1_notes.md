## The History of Sustainability - The Origins and Effects of a Popular Concept

- The term sustainability has risen in popularity rapidly, but as a consequence it is applied very loosely and liberally.
- Despite growth in popularity, there are doubts about whether it is possible to achieve.
- Sustainability is rooted in all people and culture, and is not a new idea. 
    - There is a South American lake called "Manchau gagog changau gagogchaugo gagog amaug", which means: “We fish on our side, you fish on your side and nobody fishes in the middle.” An instruction for sustainability in the pursuit of survival.
    - The Bible requires mankind to take care of the Earth and look after it; this can be seen as early sustainability
- The first documented idea of sustainability was a German mining director who suggested a form of forestry where only as much wood as could be regrown would be harvested for a "continuous, perpetual use of timber"
    - This just seems objectively good to me
- In essence, "sustainability is about the preservation of natural capital"
 > The natural stock of resources needs to remain stable and mankind has to learn to live from its yield rather than its overexploitation

- Modern sustainability was first focused on three goals: ecology, economy, and social affairs.
    - However, not much has been made towards these objectives
- With these three pillars of equal importance, interpreting sustainability becomes difficult and arbitrary
    - so, emphasis is put on the "natural assets"
        - an improved model is the "edifice" model in which the environment is the foundation on which the social, economic, and cultural pillars rest
All concepts should include the following basic principles:
- `Intergenerational Justice` - To satisfy the needs of today's generation without compromising future ones
- `Capacity for Regeneration` - Not taking more than nature can regenerate
- `Law of Succinctness` - To use non-renewables only to the extent that they can be replaced by renewables or that resource productivity can be increased
- `Reduction in Risk` - To minimise potential environmental risk and ensure safety in the manufacturing process
- `Absorption Capacity` - To generate emissions only at a level that nature can cope with over time or that can be transformed into non-toxic substances
- `Ecological-Economic Value Creation` - To maintain and promote the ecological potential and biodiversity
