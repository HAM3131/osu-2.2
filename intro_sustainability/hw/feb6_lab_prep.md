## Thredup Fashion Footprint Calculator
**Footprint**:  Low  
**Percentage**: 70% lower than the average consumer  
**CO2**:        487 lbs of CO2e annually, equal to 531 miles of driving  

## Questions
1. What do you think makes your fashion carbon footprint big or small? What are some practical things you can do to reduce your footprint?  
    *I think the thing which makes my footprint so small is likely that I really don't purchase many clothes. A lot of them are second hand too, and when I get rid of clothes I they are usually donated, not trashed. To reduce my footbprint, I could air dry my clothes more often, or mend my clothes more often.*
2. Review the Thredup life cycle calculator methodology document to identify the question you think is making a substantial impact on your fashion carbon footprint. (identified in question #2).  
    a. What is the calculation underlying the question?  
        *The underlying calculation is just a scalar multiplication for the number of things you purchase annually from each category.*  
    b. Does the calculation generate a number that looks like it is contributing a lot to your overall footprint? Briefly explain how you made this evaluation. (Note:  Some actions make more or less impact on your fashion carbon footprint, this question asks you to think about this a bit relative to a change you think you could make).  
        *I think it is contributing in a significant way, because just thinking about the answers I gave to the question, it probably contributes around 200-250 lbs of CO2, which is a substantial fraction of my overall footprint. I don't think it would really be feasible for me to reduce my clothing purchases any further though because I already don't buy that much.*
3. Review the Levi lifecycle materials? Identify in one or two sentences one way that the Levi approach differs from the ThredUp approach.  
    *The Levi approach puts the usage of a each garment into perspective with the statistic of global warming potential* per wear *instead of as a straight cost of the garment. This changes the framing for more expensive garments which you might wear less frequently and normal everyday garments which will get far more use and are thus a better investment in terms of the CO2 cost.*
