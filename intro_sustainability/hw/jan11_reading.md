## The History of Sustainability - The Origins and Effects of a Popular Concept

- The term sustainability has risen in popularity rapidly, but as a consequence it is applied very loosely and liberally.
- Despite growth in popularity, there are doubts about whether it is possible to achieve.
- Sustainability is rooted in all people and culture, and is not a new idea. 
    - There is a South American lake called "Manchau gagog changau gagogchaugo gagog amaug", which means: “We fish on our side, you fish on your side and nobody fishes in the middle.” An instruction for sustainability in the pursuit of survival.
    - The Bible requires mankind to take care of the Earth and look after it; this can be seen as early sustainability
- The first documented idea of sustainability was a German mining director who suggested a form of forestry where only as much wood as could be regrown would be harvested for a "continuous, perpetual use of timber"
    - This just seems objectively good to me
- In essence, "sustainability is about the preservation of natural capital"
 > The natural stock of resources needs to remain stable and mankind has to learn to live from its yield rather than its overexploitation

- Modern sustainability was first focused on three goals: ecology, economy, and social affairs.
    - However, not much has been made towards these objectives
- With these three pillars of equal importance, interpreting sustainability becomes difficult and arbitrary
    - so, emphasis is put on the "natural assets"
        - an improved model is the "edifice" model in which the environment is the foundation on which the social, economic, and cultural pillars rest
All concepts should include the following basic principles:
- `Intergenerational Justice` - To satisfy the needs of today's generation without compromising future ones
- `Capacity for Regeneration` - Not taking more than nature can regenerate
- `Law of Succinctness` - To use non-renewables only to the extent that they can be replaced by renewables or that resource productivity can be increased
- `Reduction in Risk` - To minimise potential environmental risk and ensure safety in the manufacturing process
- `Absorption Capacity` - To generate emissions only at a level that nature can cope with over time or that can be transformed into non-toxic substances
- `Ecological-Economic Value Creation` - To maintain and promote the ecological potential and biodiversity

## Sustainability Definitions, Historycal Context, and Frameworks

- There are many definitions for sustainable, some are lacking

## What is Sustainability

- Sustainability as a policy concept originated in the 1987 Brundtland Report.
    - Concerned with the tension between the aspirations of mankind and the limitations imposed by nature
    - "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" 
- It has since been reinterpreted as encompassing three dimensions (social, economic, and environmental)
- This has only obscured the contradictions between these objectives
- The definition should return to the focus on the well-being of future generations and the irreplaceable natural resources
- In addition two the three pillars, a distinction has also been made between "strong" and "weak" sustainability
- The idea of three pillars evolved from the business idea of the `Triple Bottom Line`
    - The interests of business do not reflect those of humanity
- Because the social, economic, and environmental pillars receive equal weight and the social and economic ones both pertain to the present while the environmental applies to the future, this view violates the principals of the Brundtland Report
    - The principal that current development should not come at the cost of future generations
- This paper proposes a model weighing well-being and the environment as the two dimensions
- `Weak Sustainability` - The idea that future generations should inherit a stock of natural and man-made resources no less than the previous generation
- `Strong Sustainability` - The idea that future generations should inherit a stock of natural resources no less than the previous generation
- There has been debate between these ideas, but the philosophy should be dependent on the resource
