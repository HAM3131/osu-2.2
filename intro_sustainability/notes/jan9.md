# Lecture 1 - Jan 9th

Beginning with some history.

1987 is the year that marks the start of the modern sustainability movement. `Gro Bruntland` is an integral figure to this idea.  

`Sustainable Development` - meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs.  

Some of the key questions that might be asked when it comes to sustainability:
 - Of what? (What is to be sustained)
 - For whom?
    - Anthropocentric (focused on people)?
    - Biocentric (all living things)?
    - Certain groups and cultures?
    - All groups and cultures?
 - For how long?
    - Businesses usually don't last long
    - Life expectancy in the US is 77.3 years.
 - At what cost?
    - What aspects of current or future lifestyles and how much of your lifetime earnings would you be willing to give up to ensure your grandchildren live comfortably?
 - Who gets to decide?
