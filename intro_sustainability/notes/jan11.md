## Sustainability Foundations
### 17th Century
`John Evelyn` was an influential figure in forestry talking about how to maintain forests.
 - He asked how forests could be moved from natural phenomena to managed and stewarded resources
 - No forests, no navy, no economy

The first mention of "sustainability" was from `Hans Carl von Carlowitz`, a german mining manager.
 - His thoughts paralleled John Evelyns
### 18th Century
**EXAM WARNING**  
`Thomas Malthus` introduced ideas akin to overshoot and the significance of scarcity.
 - He believed the population was growing faster than food production such that people would be forced to die of starvation
 - He was wrong because food production began to grow much faster
    - But this can't be taken for granted. It was not guaranteed to happen
### 20th Century
Early environmental thinkers:
 - Gifford Pinchot
 - John Muir
 - Aldo Leopold

### New Environmentalism
`Rachel Carson` - wrote a book called Silent Spring focused on DDT and other chemicals and how these disrupted the web of life to the detriment of human and wildlife health.  
The conversation now has shifted from a conversation exclusively about scarcity, but the side effects of waste produced by the modern world.

**Dominant Paradigm vs New Ecological Paradigm**
 - Limits are far away vs they are approaching
 - Business will lead to a better future vs it won't always
 - A rising tide will lift all boats vs ecological impacts will hinder this
 - etc.

`Small is Beautiful` - Book by E.F. Schumacher about "Appropriate Technology"
