# Systems I - CSE2421

This class requires a lot of coursework to be done on the [Pearson Mastering software](https://session.masteringengineering.com/myct/mastering#/). Using username `manning.545@osu.edu` and password `1313Mah@`. It is recommended apparently to access mostly by clicking the `Access Pearson` link on Carmen.

Grades will only be posted to Carmen.

Labs and homeworks will be submitted to Carmen. NO MAKEUPS.

A lot of information is also kept in the [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/lqwibtlle7p7hg) platform. Email `manning.545@osu.edu` password `1313Mah!`.

For every assignment, the top of it needs to have this certification:
```
BY SUBMITTING THIS FILE TO CARMEN, I CERTIFY THAT I HAVE STRICTLY ADHERED TO THE TENURES OF THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITYâ€™S ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY WITH RESPECT TO THIS ASSIGNMENT.
```

## Tools
I have created the `file_transfer.bat` and `ssh_stdlinux.bat` files to assist with connecting to the stdlinux setup. The former will connect via SFTP to transfer files to and from the local and remote computers. The latter will connect via ssh to the terminal. Ivanti must be connected to use either.
