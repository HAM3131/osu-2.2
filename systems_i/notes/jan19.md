`Lvalue` - The operand found on the left side of the assignment operator
`Rvalue` - The operand found on the right side of the assignment operator

## Operators
C operators can be classified according to the number of operands they take. Most C operators are `unary operators`, `binary operators`, and one `ternary operator`.  
C operands are expressions, so they can be:
 - Constants
 - Variables
 - Expressions containing operators

For ALL operators the data type on the left must be the same as the data type on the right of the operator.   

## Precedence
Precedence is the order in which operators are evaluated.
 - Mostly the same as math, but there are other operators.
 - + - * / %
