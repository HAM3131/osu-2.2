# Lecture 2
## Why OSU Teaches Java First
 - Easy to learn
 - Reasonable performance
 - Security
 - Lots of documentation
 - Lots of libraries
Blah blah blah it's a lame language
 
## Why Study C
 - It's very fast
 - Very powerful and varied repertoire of operators
 - Ready access to hardware when needed
 - Compile once, run any time
 - Preferred language for implementing other languages and compilers

## Add these to your resume now
 - C Programming language
 - Experience with the GDB debugger with C and x86-64 assembly
 - x86-64 assembly language

## Change from Java to C
 - Lower Level
 - Unsafe - you can set your computer on fire
 - C standard library
 - Similar syntax
 - Not object oriented, functional

 - Read the `CONSTRAINTS` section carefully
 - Read it again before you submit
 - Recommended to use Xterm instead of Putty
 - Get used to the `man` command and the manual pages it brings up
