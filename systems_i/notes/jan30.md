# Jan 30 - C Pointers Part 1

I've used them a bit before, I think they're pretty cool and useful.

Janis begins by using the metaphor of addresses with the class. If you're local (or have a variable name) you can just call a place by it's name. If you're on the outside though, there is a standard addressing system so anyone can figure out where you're talking about.

There are two operators associated with pointers:
 - `*` - Used when declaring variables that will hold addresses (pointers) and when you want to dereference the address to access it's contents
 - `&` - Used when we want to reference the address of a variable that has already been declared
